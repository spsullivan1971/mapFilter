I had completed this previously partially but went ahead and reviewed and finished the last problem.  Not sure that I have it totally down but do feel much better about my understanding to this point again like the rest will need to continually review and develop this.

Like the Dom some things became clearer after review.  Not as much as that one but will need to keep the momentum going to stamp it on my brain for the future.
